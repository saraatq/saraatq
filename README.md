A senior Computer Science student who loves to use the art of programming, and gets excited by having new challenges that takes me out of my comfort zone. mainly Interested in ReactJS, and Front-End technologies.
As a multipotentialite I tried different fields like Game Developing and working with Hardware and low level stuff in my graduation project, Although I enjoyed them I admire the web development field as I always wanted to create websites since I was a kid!
